The **Google Play Store App Analysis** project was conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. This involved the following steps:

### Key Process:
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Importing the dataset into Jupyter Notebooks using libraries like pandas.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data by filling, dropping, or transforming values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Using pandas and seaborn/matplotlib for generating statistical summaries, visualizations, and identifying trends like app categories, rating distributions, or download counts.
   - Plotting relationships between variables like app size vs. downloads, ratings vs. reviews, etc.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Creating new features or filtering data to isolate trends (e.g., paid vs. free apps, apps with in-app purchases).

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Applying correlation and regression analysis to investigate relationships between app characteristics and their performance metrics (e.g., download numbers, ratings).

5. **Visualization**:
   - Using Python libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to depict key findings.

This project utilized the power of Python and Jupyter to uncover insights from the Google Play Store dataset and deliver actionable data visualizations.
